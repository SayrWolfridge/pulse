# Pulse — Autonomous Cognition for AI Agents

**Give your AI agent a heartbeat.**

Pulse is a persistent daemon that gives AI agents self-directed initiative. Instead of waiting for cron jobs or human commands, your agent thinks for itself — noticing changes, prioritizing urgency, and acting autonomously.

Built for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), portable across any deployment.

## Features

⚡ **Instincts — Autonomous Skill System** *(v0.5.0)*
- Drop a folder into `instincts/` and Pulse runs it automatically when the right drives spike
- YAML frontmatter spec: declare which drives trigger the skill, cooldown, timeout, output routing
- Deterministic-first: Instincts fire *before* LLM synthesis — reliable expert behavior on demand
- Ships with 3 built-in instincts: weather market scan, memory maintenance, X engagement
- Build custom instincts in any language — Pulse just runs the script

🧠 **Autonomous Cognition**
- Drive engine with 6 built-in motivation categories (goals, curiosity, emotions, learning, social, system)
- Pressure accumulation — unfulfilled drives get louder over time
- Self-wake triggers — agent decides when to think, not you

📡 **Passive Monitoring**
- Filesystem sensor — watches workspace for changes
- Conversation sensor — detects when human is active (suppresses interruptions)
- System sensor — monitors daemon health
- Discord sensor — channel silence detection, activity scoring
- X/Twitter sensor — mention tracking, trend monitoring
- Calendar sensor — upcoming event awareness
- Git sensor — commit activity, repo health
- Web/RSS sensor — feed monitoring → curiosity drive

📊 **Observability**
- Prometheus metrics (`GET /metrics`) — drives, triggers, feedback outcomes as scrapable gauges/counters
- Visual dashboard (`GET /dashboard`) — real-time drive state, instinct log, feedback learner card
- RL-lite feedback learning — EMA-based adaptive weights; drives that succeed get reinforced automatically
- WebSocket stream — live state broadcasts every 5 seconds

🎯 **Smart Triggering**
- Rules mode (default) — simple threshold math, zero AI calls
- Model mode (optional) — context-aware decisions via local LLM
- Rate limiting — max turns/hour + cooldown prevents runaway triggers
- Conversation suppression — never interrupts active human chat

🔧 **Self-Modifying**
- Mutation system — agent evolves its own config at runtime
- Guardrails — prevents self-disabling, extreme changes, mutation spam
- Audit log — every self-modification is timestamped and explained

🚀 **Production-Ready**
- Portable — runs on Mac, Linux, Pi, VPS, Docker
- Lightweight — <50 MB RAM, <0.1% CPU idle
- Persistent — state survives restarts, migrations, hardware changes
- Zero OpenClaw coupling — communicates purely via webhook API

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/astra-ventures/pulse.git
cd pulse

# 2. Install
pip install -e .

# Or via pip (when published)
# pip install pulse-agent

# 3. Configure
mkdir -p ~/.pulse/config
cp config/pulse.example.yaml ~/.pulse/config/pulse.yaml
nano ~/.pulse/config/pulse.yaml  # set webhook_url + webhook_token

```

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for production setup (systemd, Docker, LaunchAgent).

## Configuration Example

```yaml
drives:
  trigger_threshold: 5.0
  categories:
    goals:
      weight: 1.0
      sources: ["goals.json"]
    curiosity:
      weight: 0.8
      sources: ["curiosity.json"]

sensors:
  filesystem:
    watch_paths: [".", "memory/*.md"]
  conversation:
    activity_threshold_seconds: 300

openclaw:
  min_trigger_interval: 1800  # 30 min cooldown
  max_turns_per_hour: 10
```

## Instincts — Build Your Own Autonomous Skills

Drop a folder into `pulse/instincts/` and your agent runs it automatically when drives spike:

```
instincts/
  my-skill/
    INSTINCT.md     ← trigger spec (YAML frontmatter)
    run.py          ← your script
```

**`INSTINCT.md` example:**

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Checks for new opportunities when curiosity spikes
triggers:
  drives:
    curiosity: 2.5
    goals: 1.5
  context:
    time_of_day: any
cooldown_minutes: 60
timeout_seconds: 120
output:
  discord_channel: pulse-log
---
```

Then write `run.py` — any language, any logic. Pulse runs it, captures stdout, routes output to Discord/Signal/log.

See [INSTINCT_SPEC.md](INSTINCT_SPEC.md) for the full spec and [instincts/](instincts/) for built-in examples.

## Use Cases

1. **Personal AI assistant** — proactive memory maintenance, goal tracking, creative prompts
2. **Trading bot** — rapid response to market opportunities, risk alerts
3. **Research agent** — monitors papers, datasets, experiments; triggers analysis
4. **Content creator** — detects ideas, drafts, publishing opportunities
5. **DevOps agent** — watches logs, metrics, deployments; escalates issues

## Pricing

- **Core:** Free, open source (MIT)
- **Pro (planned):** $29/mo — advanced sensors, priority support, cloud sync
- **Enterprise (planned):** $99/mo — multi-agent, custom integrations, consulting

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- OpenClaw with webhooks enabled
- 512 MB RAM minimum (1 GB recommended)

---

## Why Pulse?

**Before Pulse:**
- Agent waits for cron jobs (blind to context)
- Agent waits for human commands (reactive)
- Important things ignored until manual intervention

**With Pulse:**
- Agent notices unfulfilled goals → wakes itself
- Agent detects opportunities → acts immediately
- Agent evolves its own priorities → learns what matters

**Result:** Your AI agent feels autonomous — it thinks for itself.

## FAQ

**Q: Does Pulse replace OpenClaw heartbeats/crons?**
A: No — Pulse is complementary. Crons are for scheduled tasks. Pulse is for urgency-based tasks.

**Q: Will this spam my agent with triggers?**
A: No — rate limits + cooldowns + conversation suppression prevent spam.

**Q: Does it work with my setup?**
A: If you have OpenClaw with webhooks enabled, yes. Pulse doesn't care about your model, channels, or deployment.

**Q: Can I run Pulse on a different machine than OpenClaw?**
A: Yes! As long as Pulse can reach the webhook URL, it works.

**Q: Is model-based evaluation expensive?**
A: No — with llama3.2:3b via Ollama (local, free), it's <$0.0001/call. Or use rules mode (zero AI calls).

**Q: What if Pulse triggers when I'm busy?**
A: The conversation sensor detects active human chat and suppresses triggers.
